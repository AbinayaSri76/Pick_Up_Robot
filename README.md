## Abstract

*Gestures provide a rich and intuitive form of interaction with the robotic system.*

Gestures have been a prime source of communication since time immemorial. We have sought to improve the interaction from humans to robots through some basic hand gestures which will control the movement of the robot – both arm and wheel movements.

We have aimed for obstacle avoidance – both intentional and unintentional. Using these properties of obstacle avoidance and motion control, the Pick-Up robot can be used to clear the clutter in a room – be it our homes, workspaces, schools or public places.

## Introduction

The Pick Up is just like any other Pick-N-Place robot, but with a box attached to it to reduce wasting time and energy by avoiding going to a different place to place the items. Its obstacle-avoidance system using ultrasonic sensor avoids any damage to the robot. The gesture-controlled motion of the robot allows it to operated from the place seated and it’s much easier than a remote control. As this robot is small in size, it is accessible in most places.

This bot can be used everywhere – in homes, offices, schools, play schools, public places such as café, restaurants, temples, etc to clean up clutter like papers, cups, toys or any small solid objects.
