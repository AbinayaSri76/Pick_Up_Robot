# Pick_Up_Robot
## Abstract

*Gestures provide a rich and intuitive form of interaction with the robotic system.*

Gestures have been a prime source of communication since time immemorial. We have sought to improve the interaction from humans to robots through some basic hand gestures which will control the movement of the robot – both arm and wheel movements.

We have aimed for obstacle avoidance – both intentional and unintentional. Using these properties of obstacle avoidance and motion control, the Pick-Up robot can be used to clear the clutter in a room – be it our homes, workspaces, schools or public places.


## Description

In this system we navigate the robot via various hand gesture commands like forward, backward, left and right.
Also, we can control the robotic arm for picking up the objects.
If we gesture the robot to hit a big obstacle, the robot will turn around move.
