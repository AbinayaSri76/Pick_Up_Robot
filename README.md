# Pick_Up_Robot
## Abstract

*Gestures provide a rich and intuitive form of interaction with the robotic system.*

With the help of an obstacle avoiding, hand-gesture controlled, pick and place robot, we reduce the manual work of picking up the clutter in a room - be it our homes, workspaces or public places.

## Description

In this system we navigate the robot via various hand gesture commands like forward, backward, left and right.
Also, we can control the robotic arm for picking up the objects.
If we gesture the robot to hit a big obstacle, the robot will turn around move.
